# Security Policy
## Supported Versions
Only the latest release is supported at any time, which shouldn't be a problem, because this is a rather simple
application: it doesn't really do much.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Create a GitHub issue with the necessary details. If those details involve sensitive information, indicate the same in
the issue, and I will provide another channel of communication (if I am able to).
