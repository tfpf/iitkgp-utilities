# IIT Kharagpur Utilities
Android application which can be used to browse through the ERP and some LMS websites of Indian Institute of Technology
Kharagpur. Login credentials are automatically filled in, so there is no need to remember your passwords.

# Support
Currently, the following websites have automatic login support.
| Website          | Auto-login         |
| :--------------: | :----------------: |
| CSE Moodle       | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Institute Moodle | :heavy_check_mark: |
| ERP              | :white_check_mark: |

Android System WebView is used to display webpages, so browsing support really depends on how it renders the webpages.

# Installation
Grab the APK file from the [latest release](https://github.com/tfpf/iitkgp-utilities/releases/latest). Allow
installation of applications from unknown sources. Ignore all warnings you may get while installing.:sweat_smile:
